# **MOTOR CONTROL**

# **Description:**
For this small project, my goal was to control the speed of a motor using a potentiometer. My final project showed that when I turned the  potentiometer towards the right, the motor spun faster. And when I spun the potentiometer to the left, the motor spun far slower.

 # **Wiring/Video**

# **Reflection**

Controlling the motor was challenging. The wiring tripped me up. I didn't understand the diode when I started to wire which led to me doing it wrong. After help from the teacher and some research the project was complete. 


# **SWEEPS AND LOFTS**

# **Description:**

For this project I had to create two parts in solidworks using the instructions in the tutorial guide called sweeps and lofts.. 

### **Hammer**

### **Candle Stick**

# **Reflection:**

These two parts were fairly easy to create due to the instructions helping every step of the way. I had trouble creating the handle on the candlestick. It was a new type of sketch. This was a helpful skill to learn.

# **PHOTOINTURUPTER**

# **Description:**
For this small project I programmed a led to Light up when anything opec passed through a photo interrupter. I order to use the photo interrupter better, I  used a function called blink.

# **Code:**

[Code for photointerpter](https://github.com/hcoyle91/Arduino/blob/master/photointerupter/photointerupter.ino)

# **Reflection:**
 At first I thought that I had accidentally saughterd the photo interrupter wrongly and shorted it out. I turns out my blink function was wrong. After that the project went well.
 
 # **LED BLINK REVISITED**
 
# **Description:**
For this tiny project I made an LED blink. It helped me remember coding from last year.

# **Code:**

# **Reflection:**
This project was challenging due to me being rusty. But after I remembered stuff from last year it went
