# **MOTOR CONTROL**

# **Description:**
For this small project, my goal was to control the speed of a motor using a potentiometer. My final project showed that when I turned the  potentiometer towards the right, the motor spun faster. And when I spun the potentiometer to the left, the motor spun far slower.

# **Reflection**

Controlling the motor was challenging. The wiring tripped me up. I didn't understand the diode when I started to wire which led to me doing it wrong. After help from the teacher and some research the project was complete.
