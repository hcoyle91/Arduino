# **POTENTIOMETER**

**Description:**
For this small project, used a potentiometer to determine the brightness of an LED and a LCD screen to print how bright the led was. The brightness was printed on a scale of 1-10 on the LCD.

**Code:**

**Reflection:**
This project was simple until I put it all together and realized that I had to learn a new function in coding. I learned how to use the function "map" which helped scale what I was reading from the analog pin to my LCD screen or my LED.

# **MOTOR CONTROL**

**Description:**
For this small project, my goal was to control the speed of a motor using a potentiometer. My final project showed that when I turned the  potentiometer towards the right, the motor spun faster. And when I spun the potentiometer to the left, the motor spun far slower.

 **Wiring/Video**

**Reflection**

Controlling the motor was challenging. The wiring tripped me up. I didn't understand the diode when I started to wire which led to me doing it wrong. After help from the teacher and some research the project was complete. 



# **PHOTOINTURUPTER**

**Description:**
For this small project I programmed a led to Light up when anything opec passed through a photo interrupter. I order to use the photo interrupter better, I  used a function called blink.

**Code:**

 **Reflection:**
 At first I thought that I had accidentally saughterd the photo interrupter wrongly and shorted it out. I turns out my blink function was wrong. After that the project went well.
 










# **LED BLINK REVISITED**
 
 **Description:**
For this tiny project I made an LED blink. It helped me remember coding from last year.

**Reflection:**
This project was challenging due to me being rusty. But after I remembered stuff from last year it went well.









# **LCD BACKPACK**


**Description:**

In this assignment I learned how to use a backpack with an LCD screen. It makes it easier to use and communicate with the LCD screen.

**Wiring:**

**Code:**

**Reflection:**

This project made the LCD screen a lot easier for me. The backpack allowed me to use fewer wires. It went very smoothly.









# **LCD SCREEN**


**Description:**

For this tiny project I printed "hello lcd" on an lcd screen.

**Wiring:**

**Code:**

**Reflection:**

This project was mildly challenging. I was new to how to code the LCD screen and all the wires were very confusing. Since there were 16 wires on the back of the lcd, it confused me. I had to redo my wiring several times to make sure those were correct. After I cleaned it up, the project worked well.
